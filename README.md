## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Input**: Paste a YouTube URL and click **Extract Transcript**.
2. **Transcript Fetching**:
   - Frontend sends a request to Flask.
   - Flask retrieves the transcript using `youtube-transcript-api`.
   - Transcript is returned and displayed.
3. **Vectorization**:
   - Transcript is converted into vector format on the backend.
4. **Summary Generation**:
   - Click "Summarize Transcript".
   - Transcript is sent to OpenAI via LangChain for summarization.
   - Result is returned and shown on the UI.
5. **Conversational Q&A**:
   - Type a question about the video.
   - LangChain agent processes it using context and vector store.
   - Answer is returned and displayed in chat-like format.
